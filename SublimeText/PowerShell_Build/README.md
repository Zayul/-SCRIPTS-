## KeyBindings
I recommend using the __[PowerShellBuild KeyBinding Plugin](https://github.com/Enteleform/-SCRIPTS-/tree/master/SublimeText/PowerShell_Build/PowerShellBuild)__ to override the default build hotkeys. &nbsp; SublimeText doesn't manage build processes very well, so unless you explicitly stop builds - they will continue running as background processes.

The keybindings in the plugin automatically stop any existing builds whenever you start a new build or press <kbd>escape</kbd>.
